# README

I over-engineered a python script to move hours from CSV to Jira.


# Usage instructions

## How to run

Requirements
* Python 3.13
* Poetry

First setup things

    poetry install

This describes options and arguments

    poetry run jirahours --help

Basic usage is

    poetry run jirahours path/to/the_csv_file.csv

Software will ask
* host, e.g. `example.atlassian.net`
* username, e.g. `myemail@example.com`
* api-key, e.g. `random_letters`

Alternatively parameters can be given as env variables

    JH_HOST=example.atlassian.net \
    JH_USERNAME=my.email@example.com \
    JH_API_KEY=something \
    poetry run jirahours path/to/hours.csv


## CSV Format

CSV format rules:
* `;` is used as csv delimiter
* Double quote `"` used as csv quote character
* Row with all cells empty are skipped

Columns
* Column 1: Date, e.g. `25.01.2024`
* Column 2: Hours, e.g. `2,5` means two and a half hours
* Column 3: Jira ticket, e.g. `TICKET-123`
* Column 4: Description, e.g. `Did something`
